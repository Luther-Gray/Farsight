Farsight is a Blockbench Plugin that increases the culling distance. Perfect for creating whole worlds.

*The map of Final Fantasy XV's playable area is around 128000m. That is also the size of the purple plane.*

*If you somehow need to craft a world that's bigger than 1,000,000m, please let me know to boost the cap. Or just change it yourself.* `Line 64 in farsight.js`

## Warning!
Blockbench was not built to work with meshes and textures at this size.

`Creating a Texture` is a very dangerous choice. I recommend always importing textures when working with large meshes.
